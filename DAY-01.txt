1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 ?

      -> HTTP 2 is more fater than the HTTP 1.1
      -> HTTP/1.1, each request needed its own connection, leading to inefficiency and slower loading times, 
especially for complex web pages with many resources.
      -> HTTP 2 allows multiple requests and responses to be sent and received simultaneously on the same connection.
      -> HHTP 2 has a higher loading speed and less broadband consumption.
      -> HTTP 2 automatically prioritize.
      -> HTTP 2  reducing overhead and improving efficiency whereas HTTP 1.1 sent as plain text for each request/response,
leading to more data transfer and longer load times.
      -> In HTTP 2 data are encoded in the binary format.

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript ?

      Objects in JavaScript are fundamental data structures that allow developers to store and manipulate data efficiently. 
Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for JavaScript. 
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types and all stored in a single value depending
on their types.

INTERNAL REPRESENTATION:

HASH TABLE
     Hash tables are data structures that allow for fast lookup of values based on keys. . In JavaScript, object properties are 
typically stored in hash tables, where each property is associated with a unique hash key. 

HIDDEN CLASSES
     JavaScript engines optimize property access and memory usage by associating each object with a hidden class. 
This hidden class defines the layout and structure of the object's properties.
